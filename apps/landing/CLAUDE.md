## Where this page stands

Copied whole from the frontend owner's earlier card project on 3 Oct 2026 and
renamed; the layout, motion and section structure are what carries over. The copy
is now true to Matocard: Monad is the platform, money is dollars held as AUSD (the
Agora bounty wants AUSD on screen; MON only pays fees and no user holds it), and no
claim about locking crypto on another chain is left. **The story is still generic**,
a coffee rather than Siti: rewriting it around PLAN §2 and §3 (top up, send to Mom,
limit grows, `/verify`) is open, in Axel's words. Images and videos are the earlier
product's and carry no brand. The testimonials are placeholders. The logo is Matocard's own:
`public/matocard-logo.jpeg` is the source (a dark mark on white); the page uses the
transparent cut-outs `matocard-logo.png` (dark) and `matocard-logo-white.png`. The
header swaps them with its text colour, and the favicon picks one by
`prefers-color-scheme` in `src/app/layout.tsx`.

Next 16 still accepts React 18 as a peer, which is why this app is on 18 while
the rest of the ecosystem has moved. Do not bump React without checking
`useInView` in `src/App.tsx`: React 19 changes what `useRef<T>(null)` returns and
that signature breaks first.

## Shape of the page

`src/app/page.tsx` is a `"use client"` shell that renders `src/App.tsx`. Almost
everything lives in that one file; only the newer sections are split out under
`src/components/`.

The page opens on a **scroll-locked hero**. There is no document scroll until an
intro video has played: a wheel/touch state machine runs `idle → playing → done`,
and `Content` is not mounted at all until then (`{unlocked && <Content />}`).

**This is the thing that will waste your time.** Every section below the hero is
absent from the DOM and from the server-rendered HTML until the intro finishes.
Do not conclude a section is broken because `curl` cannot find it. To reach it in
a browser, scroll once on the hero and wait about five seconds.

Order once unlocked:

```

## Copy

Plain, second person, concrete. Say what happens to the reader's money and stop.
Two rules that are not negotiable:

**No em dashes.** Use a full stop when it is two sentences, a comma for a pause,
a colon when the second half explains the first. This started here and now applies
to anything written for this project, comments included.

**No technical talk in the marketing copy.** Contracts, proofs, attestation and
test counts belong in the README, not on this page. A visitor cares what happens
to their money, not how it is proved.

**The testimonials are placeholders and must stay legible as such.** `QUOTES` in
`QuoteCarousel.tsx` uses the standard stand-in names (Doe, Roe, Major) and the
standard fictional companies (Acme, Contoso, Initech). That is what keeps the
section a mock rather than a claim. If a real quote goes in, the real name and
company go in with it. Do not leave a real-sounding name on an invented quote.

Marketing copy is free to be warm, but a number on this page should be one a
reader could go and check.

**The "Get Matocard" links open the app** in a new tab. All three read `APP_URL`
from `src/app-url.ts`, currently `https://app.matocard.xyz`, which is not
deployed yet. Change it there once the app's domain is fixed.

## Things that will bite you

**Videos are local and web-sized; images are still remote.** Every video lives in
`public/` (`intro.mp4`, `counter.mp4`, `insight-*.mp4`), re-encoded with
`ffmpeg -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23..25 -movflags +faststart`, scaled to the
box each plays in. The intro was 29 MB at 46 Mbps for five seconds and stalled the
hero; keep any new video near 0.5 MB per second of 1080p. Hero and card imagery
still come from a Higgs CDN with no local fallback: offline, or the day those URLs
move, those images render empty.

**The top-up video carries alpha, so it has two encodings picked by engine, not by `<source>`.**
`topup-card.webm` (VP9 with alpha) for Chrome and Firefox, `topup-card.mov` (HEVC with alpha,
`hevc_videotoolbox -alpha_quality`) for Safari and everything on iOS. Chrome on a Mac would accept
the HEVC and drop its alpha, so `<source>` order cannot do it. The source was
`card-animation.mp4` (Axel, 10 Oct), matted frame by frame with rembg `isnet-general-use` joined
with a colour key on the blue backdrop, since the model alone dropped the falling coins. The video
shows other banks' and networks' marks (monobank, Mastercard, VISA); Axel chose to keep them.

**Video needs `muted` set through a ref**, not only as a JSX prop. React does not
reliably reflect it as a DOM attribute, and an unmuted video is blocked from
autoplaying. Both `ReachSection` and `InsightsSection` do this.

**The ring video ships in three encodings.** The source is HEVC, which Firefox
will not decode and Chrome only will on some platforms, so a VP9 WebM and an
H.264 MP4 follow it. Browsers take the first source they can read, so the order
is smallest-first. Add a source, keep the order.

**File extensions must match the bytes.** Next sets `Content-Type` from the
extension. Two icons arrived as WebP named `.avif` and were renamed; check with
`file` before adding an asset, not by trusting the name.

**Biome lints this workspace.** `bun run lint` runs from the repo root and it is
strict: no `any`, no unused anything, `type` required on every button, a11y rules
on. `noUnknownAtRules` is switched off for this app's CSS only, because Tailwind
3 directives are not at-rules Biome knows.

**There is no local webfont.** `.font-helvetica-neue` is a system stack only.
An earlier `@font-face` pointed at a `/fonts/` file that was never in the repo
and 404'd on every load; it was removed and nothing about the rendering changed.

**Global `* { font-family: Geist }` beats Tailwind font classes** on child
elements. That is why `.font-helvetica-neue` in `index.css` uses a descendant
selector rather than living in `tailwind.config.js`.

**This app and `apps/app` both default to :3000.** Only one can have it, and the
one that loses starts on 3001 or dies. If a page you expect looks like a
different product entirely, check which server actually holds the port before
debugging the page, `lsof -nP -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN` and read the process cwd.
Pass `--port` explicitly when running both.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes: APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev`: verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
