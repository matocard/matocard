Matocard.

## Where this page stands

Copied whole from the frontend owner's earlier card project on 3 Oct 2026 and
renamed; the layout, motion and section structure are what carries over. **The
story is not Matocard's yet.** The copy, the chat demo, the features, the stats and
every image and video still describe the earlier product. They have to be rewritten
around PLAN §2 and §3 (Siti, top up, send to Mom, limit grows, `/verify`), in
Axel's words, before the page is shown to anyone. The logo is Matocard's own:
`public/matocard-logo.jpeg` is the source (a dark mark on white); the page uses the
transparent cut-outs `matocard-logo.png` (dark) and `matocard-logo-white.png`. The
header swaps them with its text colour, and the favicon picks one by
`prefers-color-scheme` in `src/app/layout.tsx`.

Next 16 still accepts React 18 as a peer, which is why this app is on 18 while
the rest of the ecosystem has moved. Do not bump React without checking
`useInView` in `src/App.tsx`: React 19 changes what `useRef<T>(null)` returns and
that signature breaks first.

## Shape of the page

`src/app/page.tsx` is a `"use client"` shell that renders `src/App.tsx`. Almost
everything lives in that one file; only the newer sections are split out under
`src/components/`.

The page opens on a **scroll-locked hero**. There is no document scroll until an
intro video has played: a wheel/touch state machine runs `idle → playing → done`,
and `Content` is not mounted at all until then (`{unlocked && <Content />}`).

**This is the thing that will waste your time.** Every section below the hero is
absent from the DOM and from the server-rendered HTML until the intro finishes.
Do not conclude a section is broken because `curl` cannot find it. To reach it in
a browser, scroll once on the hero and wait about five seconds.

Order once unlocked:

## Copy

Plain, second person, concrete. Say what happens to the reader's money and stop.
Two rules that are not negotiable:

**No em dashes.** Use a full stop when it is two sentences, a comma for a pause,
a colon when the second half explains the first. This started here and now applies
to anything written for this project, comments included.

**No technical talk in the marketing copy.** Contracts, proofs, attestation and
test counts belong in the README, not on this page. A visitor cares what happens
to their money, not how it is proved.

**The testimonials are placeholders and must stay legible as such.** `QUOTES` in
`QuoteCarousel.tsx` uses the standard stand-in names (Doe, Roe, Major) and the
standard fictional companies (Acme, Contoso, Initech). That is what keeps the
section a mock rather than a claim. If a real quote goes in, the real name and
company go in with it. Do not leave a real-sounding name on an invented quote.

Marketing copy is free to be warm, but a number on this page should be one a
reader could go and check.

**The "Get Matocard" links open the app** in a new tab. All three read `APP_URL`
from `src/app-url.ts`, currently `https://app.matocard.xyz`, which is not
deployed yet. Change it there once the app's domain is fixed.

## Things that will bite you

**Assets are remote and hardcoded.** Hero imagery comes from a Higgs CDN and the
stat cards pull three CloudFront MP4s. There is no local fallback: offline, or
the day those URLs move, those sections render empty. Everything under `public/`
is ours and safe.

**Video needs `muted` set through a ref**, not only as a JSX prop. React does not
reliably reflect it as a DOM attribute, and an unmuted video is blocked from
autoplaying. Both `ReachSection` and `InsightsSection` do this.

**The ring video ships in three encodings.** The source is HEVC, which Firefox
will not decode and Chrome only will on some platforms, so a VP9 WebM and an
H.264 MP4 follow it. Browsers take the first source they can read, so the order
is smallest-first. Add a source, keep the order.

**File extensions must match the bytes.** Next sets `Content-Type` from the
extension. Two icons arrived as WebP named `.avif` and were renamed; check with
`file` before adding an asset, not by trusting the name.

**Biome lints this workspace.** `bun run lint` runs from the repo root and it is
strict: no `any`, no unused anything, `type` required on every button, a11y rules
on. `noUnknownAtRules` is switched off for this app's CSS only, because Tailwind
3 directives are not at-rules Biome knows.

**There is no local webfont.** `.font-helvetica-neue` is a system stack only.
An earlier `@font-face` pointed at a `/fonts/` file that was never in the repo
and 404'd on every load; it was removed and nothing about the rendering changed.

**Global `* { font-family: Geist }` beats Tailwind font classes** on child
elements. That is why `.font-helvetica-neue` in `index.css` uses a descendant
selector rather than living in `tailwind.config.js`.

**This app and `apps/app` both default to :3000.** Only one can have it, and the
one that loses starts on 3001 or dies. If a page you expect looks like a
different product entirely, check which server actually holds the port before
debugging the page, `lsof -nP -iTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN` and read the process cwd.
Pass `--port` explicitly when running both.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes: APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev`: verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
