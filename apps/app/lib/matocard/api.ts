/**
 * Read surface of the Matocard backend (`apps/api`), which is a different service from the vault
 * backend `lib/api/` talks to. Two clients, two env vars, deliberately: `apps/api` serves the credit
 * line (score, limit, KYC, card), the vault backend serves buckets and yield. Pointing one at the
 * other would 404 every read.
 *
 * Same three disciplines as `lib/api/client.ts`, for the same reasons:
 *   1. Never throws. Callers get a `Result`, so a dead backend degrades a screen instead of blanking
 *      it, and nobody can forget a `try`.
 *   2. Env-gated. With `NEXT_PUBLIC_MATOCARD_API_URL` unset no request is issued at all, which is
 *      what keeps vitest and Playwright offline.
 *   3. Amounts stay strings. They are wei, and `Number()` loses precision above ~9e15.
