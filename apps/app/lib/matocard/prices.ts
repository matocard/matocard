/**
 * USD prices, for display only.
 *
 * **This is not the oracle and must never become it.** `lib/matocard/oracle.ts` reads prices from
 * contracts, and `collateralValueOf` on the credit line decides what a deposit is worth in credit.
 * Those numbers move limits. These move nothing: they exist so a figure can be read as money by
 * somebody who does not hold a view on what tCTC is worth. A price fetched over HTTP from a third
 * party has no business deciding how much anyone can borrow.
 *
 * That separation also explains a gap a reader will notice. The chain prices 1 tUSDC at 1 tCTC,
 * while the market prices USDC at a dollar and MON at about ten cents. So a wallet showing $50 of
 * deposits against a $3.79 limit is not a bug: it is a testnet price table meeting a mainnet one.
 * The USD figure describes the asset, the tCTC figure describes the credit, and they are answers to
 * different questions.
 *
 * **Testnet tokens are priced as their mainnet counterparts.** tUSDC is not USDC and tCTC is not
 * MON; neither has a market. Quoting the real asset is the only meaningful number available and it
 * is the same thing `oracle.ts` already does with Chainlink and the Uniswap pool. It is honest for
 * a demo and it is not collateral-grade pricing. Say it that way if anyone asks.
