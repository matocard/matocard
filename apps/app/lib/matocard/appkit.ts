/**
 * The one AppKit instance, built lazily in the browser.
 *
 * Reown's own guidance is to call `createAppKit` at module scope, and this does exactly that in
 * effect: it runs once, on first need, and every later caller gets the same instance. What it
 * deliberately avoids is running during **server** rendering. `Web3Provider` is a client component,
 * but Next still evaluates its module graph on the server, and a static `createAppKit` there pulls
 * the connector stack into the SSR bundle. That is how the ethers adapter took every route down
 * with an unresolvable `@x402/*` import; the shape of that failure is not adapter-specific, so the
 * guard stays.
 *
 * `Web3Provider` warms this from an effect, so the modal is built and ready before anyone taps
 * Connect rather than on the tap itself.
