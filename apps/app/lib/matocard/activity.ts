/**
 * One row in the activity list.
 *
 * This lived in `lib/vault/data.ts` beside a fixture generator for yield buckets, which is how
 * three live files (`useTransactions`, `ActivityList`, `ActivityRow`) ended up importing a seam
 * from the old product to render Matocard's own transactions. The import was type-only and the
 * rows are built from Monad logs, so nothing was ever mocked; but it was the only thing
 * keeping that module alive.
 *
 * `cat` is the pair the old Earn screen split its feed by: the holder's own actions against the
 * agent's. Matocard has no agent, so every row is `"you"`, and the field stays only because
 * `ActivityList` still renders the distinction. `group` is the one that earns its place: it is what
 * the Transactions filter and the desktop drawer sort on.
