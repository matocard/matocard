/**
 * The signed message the guardians publish, fetched by the app rather than waited on.
 *
 * **Why the app asks at all.** A withdrawal is three transactions: the holder requests a release on
 * Monad, the guardians sign it, and somebody submits that signature to the far chain so the
 * relay can approve the release. The app presented the middle step as "nothing for you to do" and
 * waited for the worker, which is a daemon that has been down for a day at a time (#12). Meanwhile
 * `ReleaseRelay.executeRelease(bytes calldata vaa)` carries no access modifier at all: its safety
 * comes from verifying that the message was emitted by our hub on Monad, not from who sent it.
 * So the holder can submit it themselves, and an app that makes them wait on our infrastructure to
 * get their own collateral back is making a custodial product out of a trustless path.
 *
 * The worker still relays. This is the same button it presses, in the holder's hands, and whichever
 * gets there first wins: `consumedVaa` makes the second attempt revert with `AlreadyConsumed`
 * rather than paying out twice.
 *
 * **The emitter is the hub, not the vault.** Deposits are emitted by each chain's vault and
 * releases by the hub on Monad, so the same endpoint with the wrong emitter returns a
 * confident 404 for a message that exists. The worker carries the same footgun in a comment.

/**
 * Wormhole's own id for Monad, which is where a release is published from.
 *
 * **59, and it does not follow the 10000-block testnet pattern.** I wrote 10009 here first, by
 * extrapolating from Base at 10004, which is the exact mistake that put Fuji at 10006 and shipped.
 * This is read off the deployed relay: `HUB_CHAIN_ID()` on BSC Testnet's ReleaseRelay returns 59,
 * and it is the value a release VAA is rejected against, so a wrong one here means every fetch
 * returns a confident 404 for a message that exists.
