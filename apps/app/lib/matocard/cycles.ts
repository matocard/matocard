/**
 * The borrowing cycles a card has been through, assembled from draws and repayments.
 *
 * **This is what earns the limit, and nothing on any screen showed it.** A cycle opens on a draw
 * and closes on the repayment that clears the balance to zero. Only a closed cycle raises the
 * score, and only the score makes the same collateral buy a bigger limit. That sentence is the
 * product, and a cardholder had no way to see how many they had completed or what any one of them
 * did.
 *
 * **A cycle shorter than `minCycleDuration` scores nothing, silently.** The deployed contract sets
 * it to 60 seconds rather than the 1-day default. A draw repaid faster settles the debt, moves the
 * score by zero, and emits no error and no explanation. That is recorded in the root CLAUDE.md as
 * one of the traps that costs an afternoon, and it is invisible on chain: the repayment looks
 * identical to one that scored. Marking those rows is the one thing this file exists to make
 * possible.
 *
 * **What this cannot show is the limit at the time.** `ScoreChanged` carries the score, the limit
 * and the available credit together, but the indexer consumes it to update one `Account` row and
 * keeps no history of it, so there is no series to read. Reading the logs directly is not an
 * option either: the Monad RPC enforces a 10-second query timeout, and a 50,000-block window
 * exceeds it while 5,000 blocks answers in about 1.3 seconds, so a full history would be dozens of
 * serial round trips. Issue filed. Until then this screen shows what happened, not what the limit
 * was when it happened, and it does not guess.
