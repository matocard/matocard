 * The distinction this file exists for: a receipt arriving is not the transaction having worked.

 * then reporting success: the cross-chain lock, the faucet, the ERC20 approval before a lock, and
 * through `receipt.isSuccess`, every draw and repayment. A green check on a reverted draw is the
 * worst of them: it tells someone money moved when it did not.
