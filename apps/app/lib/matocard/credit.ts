 * The limit maths, mirrored from `CreditScoring.sol` so a screen can answer "what does locking this

 *
 * These constants are a copy of on-chain ones, which is a real risk worth naming: change them in
 * Solidity and this file is silently wrong. It is a preview only. Every figure a screen commits to
 * still comes from `limitOf` / `availableOf` read live off the contract, so the worst this can do
 * is misquote an estimate, never misreport a limit.
 *
 * Worked example, matching `docs/e2e-testnet-run.md`: 0.6 tCTC of collateral at score 42 gives
 * bps = 15000 - 7000 x 42/100 = 12060, and 0.6 x 10000 / 12060 = 0.497512437810945273 tCTC.

 * hitting it is the failure mode worth avoiding: the transaction costs gas and the error names two
 * numbers rather than an action.
 *
 * So this is the same inequality solved for the other side. The limit must stay at or above what is
 * drawn, and `limitFrom(v, score) = v * 10000 / bps`, which gives the smallest value that still
 * carries the debt as `ceil(drawn * bps / 10000)`. Everything above that is free.

 * Rounded UP, deliberately. Rounding the requirement down would produce a maximum that is one wei
 * too generous, and the whole point is that the number is safe to act on.
