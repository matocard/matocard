/**
 * What ETH and MON are worth, read from contracts rather than from a price API.
 *
 * Monad has no price feed of its own: `eth_getCode` is empty at the standard Pyth, API3 and
 * RedStone addresses on CC3. So both legs are read from Ethereum, where the market actually is.
 *
 *   ETH/USD   Chainlink's aggregator on Sepolia. A real decentralised feed, updated continuously.
 *   ETH/MON   The Uniswap V2 MON/WETH pool's reserve ratio on Ethereum mainnet. MON has no
 *             Chainlink feed anywhere, and this pool is the only on-chain market for it.
 *
 * MON/USD then falls out of the two, with no third source needed.
 *
 * **This is a spot read of a thin pool.** About 1.8 WETH sits in that pair, which is cheap to move.
 * It tracks the centralised price closely today (within ~1.2% when last checked) and it is the
 * honest way to show a live number in a testnet demo, but it is not collateral-grade pricing and
 * should not be described as such.
 *
 * Both reads are also *provable*: each is an event in a transaction Attestcoin can verify on
 * Monad, which is how `ASCCreditLine.setCollateralPrice` could stop being operator-fed. That
 * is a contract change, not a frontend one; this file just reads the same sources directly.
