/**
 * A release that has left Monad and not yet arrived on the far chain.
 *
 * **The gap this exists to cover, found on a live withdrawal.** `requestRelease` debits the hub
 * immediately, and `releasable` on the far vault only becomes non-zero once somebody submits the
 * guardians' signature. Between those two the holder owns the money and no contract reports it:
 * `credited` is 0 and `releasable` is 0. The withdraw screen read both, concluded "Nothing of yours
 * is held on BSC Testnet", and hid the very button that finishes the withdrawal. Axel hit this on
 * his own 0.01 BNB, mid-flow, with the VAA already signed and waiting.
 *
 * The indexer does record the request, but it is a second system with its own lag, and this is the
 * one moment the screen is being stared at. So the request is remembered here the instant its
 * receipt lands, from data read out of that receipt, and the screen stops depending on anything
 * else having caught up.
 *
 * **Nothing here is trusted for money.** The entry carries a sequence and an amount, which are used
 * to fetch a signature the relay verifies anyway, and to render a figure. A forged or stale entry
 * produces a fetch that returns nothing or a transaction the relay rejects. It cannot move funds,
 * which is why it is safe to keep somewhere a person can edit.
