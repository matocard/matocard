/**
 * "3h ago", and nothing else.
 *
 * This file also held `itemFromEntry`, which mapped an old backend's `FeedEntry` wire row into a
 * rendered one. That backend is not in this repo and the rows Matocard renders are built from
 * Monad logs, so the mapper had no caller and its two type imports were the last thing tying
 * the transactions list to modules that no longer exist.
 *
 * Still pure and still takes `now` from the caller: reading the clock during render bakes a
 * timestamp into the SSR HTML and desyncs the first client paint.
