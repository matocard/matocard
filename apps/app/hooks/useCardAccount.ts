/**
 * The connected wallet's credit-line account, as `apps/api` sees it.
 *
 * Deliberately has no fixture fallback, unlike the vault hooks. A card is a claim about a real
 * identity and a real limit: with the backend off or unreachable the honest answer is "we do not
 * know yet", not a plausible-looking card. `account` stays null and the screen says so.
 *
 * KYC resolves through Didit's webhook, so the verdict never arrives in the response to our own
 * request. `refresh` is what the screen calls when the user comes back from the Didit tab.
 *
 * **React Query, and the reason is the desktop/mobile split rather than tidiness.** This was a raw
 * `useEffect` and `useState`, so two mounted callers meant two real `GET /account/:wallet` calls.
 * Home branches on `useIsDesktop`, which is false on the first client render and true immediately
 * after, so `MobileHome` mounted, fetched, painted, and then `DesktopOverview` mounted and fetched
 * again. Every other hook on that screen absorbed it because they are all Query-backed; this one
 * was the exception. It matters more now: replacing the JS branch with a CSS one mounts both trees
 * at once, which would have made the duplicate permanent rather than transient.
 *
 * Keyed by address alone, never by a refresh counter. An earlier version keyed on `address#nonce`,
 * which meant every `refresh()` invalidated the data it already had: `account` went null for the
 * length of the round trip, and Home read that null as "identity not required" and flipped its
 * button from Verify identity to Deposit and back on every window focus. `invalidateQueries`
 * refetches in place and keeps the previous answer on screen. Only a change of wallet discards.
