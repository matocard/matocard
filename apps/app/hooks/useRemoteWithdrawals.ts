/**
 * Withdrawals this wallet has asked for and not yet taken.
 *
 * A withdrawal is three transactions on two chains, and only the first and last are the borrower's.
 * Between them the guardians sign and the relay lets the vault release the money, which is the
 * protocol working; after them the money sits in the vault until the borrower signs for it, which
 * is not the protocol waiting on anything. `RemoteWithdrawal` carries a timestamp for each, so the
 * two gaps can be told apart and neither is described as the other.
 *
 * Reading this rather than holding the stage in component state is what makes a request survive a
 * reload. Without it, leaving the screen between asking and claiming erases every trace of the
 * request except a limit that dropped for no reason anyone can see.
 *
 * An unreachable indexer throws rather than answering "no withdrawals": the two are different, and
 * reporting the second when the first is true is how a screen says something it does not know.
