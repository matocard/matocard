/**
 * The wallet's real transaction history, straight from the Envio indexer.

 * Seven row types across six chains, merged into one feed: draws and repayments on Monad,
 * Attestcoin locks on Sepolia with the proofs that carry them across, defaults, and the Wormhole
 * deposits and withdrawals from the other five chains. They are interleaved by block timestamp,
 * which is the only ordering that makes sense when the events come from different chains.
 *
 * The Wormhole rows were missing at first and the gap was silent: a cross-chain deposit raised the
 * limit and nothing in the list accounted for it, because `CollateralLock` only covers Sepolia.
 *
 * Rows are emitted as `ActivityItem`, the shape `ActivityList` and `ActivityRow` already render, so
 * the feed gained real data without a single icon or layout change. New `kind` values map onto
 * icons that already existed.
 *
 * Unlike the vault feed this has **no fixture fallback**. An empty list here means the chain has no
 * record of this wallet, which is a true and useful statement; inventing rows would not be.
