/**
 * The record a score is built from: every borrow, every repayment, in time order.
 *
 * **Built from events, not from a score series, because no score series exists.** The indexer's
 * `Account` row carries one current `score` and one current `limit` and no history of either. What
 * it does keep is `Draw` and `Repayment` rows with timestamps, so the shape of someone's record is
 * reconstructable even though the curve of their score is not. That is a real limit and the chart
 * is drawn to it: bars are what happened, never an interpolated score.
 *
 * A borrow that has been settled is counted separately from one still open, because only a
 * repayment clearing the balance to zero closes a cycle and scores. Colouring them the same would
 * show a record that has not been earned yet.
