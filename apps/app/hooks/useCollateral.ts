/**
 * Everything backing this wallet's credit limit: the native lock plus every listed ERC20.
 *
 * Two chains and two states per asset, and conflating them is the mistake to avoid. Collateral
 * **locked** on Sepolia is not yet collateral **proved** on Monad: Attestcoin runs seven to
 * nine minutes behind, so between a lock and its proof the vault says you have it and the credit
 * line says you do not. Both numbers are read and reported separately, because during that window
 * they genuinely disagree and only one of them raises a limit.
 *
 * The token list is read from `listedTokens()` rather than an env var. Listing a token is a
 * governance call on the credit line, so the chain is the only source that cannot go stale.
 *
 * `totalValue` comes from `collateralValueOf`, not from summing here. Each token is priced per
 * WHOLE token against its own decimals, and re-deriving that in TypeScript is how a 6-decimal
 * stablecoin ends up valued at a trillionth of its worth.
