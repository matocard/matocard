 * USD prices, read through this app's own route rather than from CoinGecko directly.
 *
 * See `app/api/prices/route.ts` for why the hop exists: the keyless API is rate limited per IP and
 * documents itself as unsuitable for polling, so one server-side cache serves everybody.
 *
 * An hour of `staleTime` and no refetch on focus or reconnect. These figures are decoration beside
 * numbers read from chains; re-fetching them because somebody switched tabs would spend requests to
 * change the fourth decimal of a caption.
 *
 * **Failure is empty, never zero.** The route answers `{}` when it has nothing, `usdOf` returns
 * null for a symbol with no price, and every caller falls back to showing tCTC. There is no error
 * state to render because there is nothing a person would do about it.
