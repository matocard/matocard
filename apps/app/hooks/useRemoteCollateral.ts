/**
 * Collateral deposited on chains Attestcoin cannot reach.
 *
 * Attestcoin proves Ethereum and Sepolia only. Everything else arrives by Wormhole: the asset is
 * held in a vault on its own chain, a signed message says so, and `WormholeCollateralHub` on
 * Monad accounts for it. The asset never moves, which is the same promise the Attestcoin path
 * makes.
 *
 * **This exists because `collateralValueOf` already counts it.** The credit line adds the hub's
 * total to its own, so a screen reading only `listedTokens()` reports a limit backed by more than
 * the rows it lists: the figures disagree and neither is wrong. Reading the hub is what closes
 * that gap.
 *
 * Assets are keyed by `keccak256(chainId, token)`, never by address alone: USDC on Base and USDC on
 * Arbitrum are different assets in different vaults, and a depeg on one says nothing about the
 * other. The chain and token behind an id come from the `AssetListed` log rather than a table here,
 * for the same reason the Sepolia list is read from chain: listing is a governance call, and the
 * log cannot go stale.
