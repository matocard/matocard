/**
 * What the limit has been, which the chain cannot answer.
 *
 * `limitOf` is read live everywhere else in this app, and that is right: repricing collateral moves
 * every limit at once without an event per account, so only the contract knows the figure now. The
 * cost of that design is that the contract has no memory, and this screen's whole subject is a
 * number that is supposed to grow. `ScoreChanged` is the event that records each move, and the
 * indexer keeps one row per emission.
 *
 * **The rows are kept and the line is filtered, which are two different things.** `refreshScore` is
 * permissionless and re-emits whether or not anything moved, so the same account can produce two
 * identical rows minutes apart. Drawing a point per row puts flat steps on the chart at moments
 * nothing happened. `changed` is the indexer's own comparison against the row before it, so the
 * line is drawn from those and the ledger keeps everything.
