/**
 * Where Didit sends the user after verification (`KYC_CALLBACK_URL`).
 *
 * **This page has no logic on purpose, and must not grow any.** The verdict reaches us through
 * Didit's webhook to `apps/kyc`, never through this redirect, so anything decided here from the
 * query string would be a second source of truth for whether someone is verified, and the one a
 * user can edit in their address bar. The page says what Didit said and sends them back.
 *
 * It carries the route name from the app this one replaced, because the KYC service on Railway is
 * configured with the path. Renaming it here without repointing `KYC_CALLBACK_URL` would land every
 * verified user on a 404, and it would fail quietly: the webhook still records them, so only the
 * person verifying would ever see it.
 *
 * The card screen re-reads on focus, so a user who closes this tab instead of tapping through still
 * gets their card the moment the webhook lands.
