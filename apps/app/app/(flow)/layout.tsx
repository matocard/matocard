 * falls back to /home. Mobile is untouched: `useIsDesktop` is false there, so children render as

 * byte-identical: desktop UI never navigates here (it uses `open(panel)`), only manual URLs do.

        `min-h-[calc(100dvh-92px)]`, and 92 is nothing but `pt-[52px]` plus `pb-10` added up by hand.
        Nothing connected the two, so changing the padding here would have left every flow screen
        the wrong height with no error anywhere. `min-h-dvh` with `border-box` already makes this
        content box exactly `100dvh - 92px`, so a `flex-1` child measures the same and keeps
        measuring the same.
