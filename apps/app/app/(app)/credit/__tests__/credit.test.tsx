 * The middle tab after it stopped reporting APY it never paid.
 *
 * Two things are worth pinning. The headline has to be the score, because the score is the only
 * figure a holder can move and the whole product is that moving it buys more credit per unit of
 * collateral. And an empty record has to look empty: this is the one screen whose subject is a
 * truthful history, so filling the chart with an example would undo it.
