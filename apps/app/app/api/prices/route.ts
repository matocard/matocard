/**
 * One CoinGecko call per hour for everybody, instead of one per visitor per page load.
 *
 * The keyless CoinGecko API allows roughly ten to thirty calls a minute against the caller's IP and
 * documents itself as unsuitable for scheduled polling. Fetching from the browser would spend that
 * budget on every mount of every screen, and a demo with a few people watching would sit on 429s.
 * Going through the server means one caller, one cache, and a number that is the same for everyone
 * looking at the same screen.
 *
 * **Next's Data Cache is the Redis here.** `revalidate` on the outbound fetch is a shared, timed
 * cache maintained by the framework, which is the thing a Redis entry would have been. Adding an
 * actual Redis would mean another service to run, another URL in the environment, and another
 * component that can be down, in exchange for behaviour this already has. If the app ever needs a
 * cache shared across separately deployed instances, that is the moment to revisit it.
 *
 * **The last good answer is kept and served when CoinGecko does not answer.** Prices are decoration
 * here rather than an input to anything financial, so an hour-old figure is worth more than a blank
 * where a number should be. It is unlabelled on purpose: Axel asked for a snapshot rather than a
 * live feed, and stamping "as of 13:05" on a decorative figure draws the eye to the least important
 * thing on the screen. Nothing is invented, though. Before a first successful fetch this returns an
 * empty object and every caller falls back to tCTC.
