/**
 * The asset here is BSC's native coin, so every label reads BNB. That is the fix these expectations
 * carry: the screen used to hardcode `native ? "ETH" : "USDC"` and would have told someone they were
 * withdrawing ETH from a chain that has none.
 *
 * A withdrawal is three transactions on two chains, and the screen's whole job is to be honest
 * about which one the borrower is in.
 *
 * The two mistakes worth pinning are opposites. Saying "withdrawn" once the guardians have signed
 * claims the money is in their wallet when it is sitting in a vault waiting for a signature they
 * have not given. And losing the request on a reload leaves them with a limit that dropped and
 * nothing on screen accounting for it: which is why the stage is read from the indexer rather than
 * remembered in component state.
