/**
 * Taking back collateral that was proved from Sepolia by Attestcoin.
 *
 * **Half of this path is ours and half is the holder's, and until now neither half existed here.**
 * `SourceVault.approveTokenRelease` is `onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)`, and `unlockToken` then pays out up
 * to whatever was approved. So a release is two steps by two different people. The app had a screen
 * for neither, which meant a cardholder who repaid in full and asked how to get their deposit back
 * had no answer on Sepolia at all. Axel asked exactly that this afternoon, which is why this exists.
 *
 * This screen is the holder's half. It cannot approve anything and does not pretend to: when the
 * allowance is zero it says so plainly, names who clears it, and stops. When it is not zero, the
 * button is a real `unlockToken` and the money lands in the wallet.
 *
 * **Why not just hide the screen when nothing is approved.** Because "you cannot withdraw this" and
 * "nobody has approved it yet" are different sentences and only the second one is true. Hiding it
 * is how the collateral list ended up looking like a feature that failed to load.
 *
 * **Why Sepolia is not like the Wormhole chains.** Collateral there comes home without anyone's
 * permission: `ReleaseRelay` holds the operator role and relays what the guardians signed. Sepolia
 * has no such relay, because Attestcoin writability is still in third-party audit and Monad
 * cannot write back to Ethereum, so the operator is still a person. That is the honest difference
 * and #13 is where it is being discussed.
