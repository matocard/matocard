/**
 * Taking cross-chain collateral home.
 *
 * This is the half of the Wormhole path that used to need us. `WormholeVault.approveRelease` is
 * operator-gated and the operator was the team, which is honest and custodial: a borrower's
 * collateral came back when we said so. A `ReleaseRelay` holds that role on each chain now and
 * approves nothing of its own accord: it relays what the guardians signed, and the guardians only
 * sign what Monad published after checking the debt still stands up.
 *
 * **Three steps, and the screen has to be honest that it is three.**
 *
 * 1. `requestRelease` on Monad. This is where it can be refused.
 * 2. The guardians sign and the worker relays it. Nothing for the user to do, but it is real time,
 *    well under a minute for BSC and Fuji, fifteen to twenty for the three L2s, which publish at
 *    finalized consistency and so finalize against Ethereum.
 * 3. **A second transaction the user signs.** The relay approves; it does not push funds, because
 *    the vault never sends to an address it was not asked to. A screen that said "withdrawn" after
 *    step 2 would be lying, so step 3 is a state of its own and it leads whenever it is available.
 *
 * **The maximum is computed rather than discovered.** `requestRelease` debits first and then asks
 * the credit line what the limit is worth without the collateral, reverting
 * `ReleaseWouldStrandDebt(drawn, remainingLimit)` if the borrower would be left owing more than the
 * remainder supports. Letting someone find that edge by hitting it costs gas and returns two
 * numbers instead of an action, so `releasableValue` solves the same inequality the other way and
 * the keypad is capped by it. The refusal is still handled: the contract is the authority and this
 * is a mirror of its arithmetic, but it should not be how anyone learns the rule.
 *
 * **Only the Wormhole path works this way.** Collateral proved from Sepolia by Attestcoin is
 * released by a person, because Attestcoin writability is in third-party audit and Monad
 * cannot write back to Ethereum. That asymmetry is deliberate and worth saying out loud rather than
 * calling the whole product non-custodial.
