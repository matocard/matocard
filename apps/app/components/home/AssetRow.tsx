/**
 * One wallet balance, in the same shape as the bucket rows it replaced: logo, name, a chip naming
 * the chain, and the figures right-aligned. The markup deliberately mirrors `BucketRow` so the card
 * looks identical; only the content is different, because a balance is not a yield position.
 *
 * The second line is the USD value, not an APY, and so it is muted rather than green. Green in this
 * app means a gain, and holding a token is not one.
 *
 * No chain chip. Which testnet a balance sits on is not something the holder of the card needs to
 * read every time they open the app; `asset.network` is still carried for screens that do.
