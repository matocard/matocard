/**
 * What the `···` pill opens.
 *
 * I argued against an overflow at first, on the grounds that a menu holding nothing is furniture.
 * That was right about a menu of invented actions and wrong about this one: there are three real
 * things a cardholder can do that have nowhere else to sit on Home: take a deposit back, get test
 * tokens, and read the full history. Two of them were only reachable through Account.
 *
 * **Withdraw only lists what can actually be withdrawn.** A deposit that arrived by Wormhole has a
 * trustless release path: `requestRelease` on Monad, the guardians, then the holder's own
 * signature. One proved from Sepolia by Attestcoin does not, because `SourceVault.approveRelease` is
 * gated on the team while Attestcoin writability is in third-party audit and Monad cannot write
 * back to Ethereum. Offering a control that ends in "ask us" is worse than not offering it, so those
 * assets simply do not appear here.
 *
 * This sheet is the only place withdrawal is offered. `CollateralList` used to carry a chevron on
 * the Wormhole rows and a line of explanation on the others, which made a list about what backs the
 * limit spend half its space on a different subject.
