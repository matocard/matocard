/**
 * Home's headline figure: what the card can actually spend.
 *
 * This replaced a wallet total, and the swap is the point. The old hero read "Total value $813",
 * the sum of MON and ETH sitting in the wallet across two chains. Both numbers were true and the
 * pairing was misleading: on a credit card, the wallet balance is not the spending power. A holder
 * with 7,999 tCTC in their wallet and a 0.4975 tCTC limit can spend 0.4975, and the screen was
 * leading with the other figure by a factor of sixteen thousand.
 *
 * So the hero is `spendable`, which is the number the card is actually bounded by, and it comes
 * from the backend's own card state rather than being re-derived here: `spendable` is the minimum
 * of available credit and whatever else gates the card, and recomputing that in the client is how
 * a screen ends up promising credit the card will refuse.
 *
 * Nothing sits under it. The limit and the score were there to explain the headline and did the
 * opposite: three figures in a stack, two of which a reader has to already understand to know why
 * they differ. Both have a screen of their own where they are the subject.
 *
 * Left-aligned rather than centred. A centred figure with a row of actions under it makes the
 * actions look like a caption for it; aligned to the same edge they read as a column (label,
 * number, what you can do) and the eye travels one line rather than three.
 *
 * **The figure can be read in dollars, and only this figure.** tCTC means nothing to somebody who
 * has not looked up what Monad trades at, and this is the number the whole screen is about. The
 * swap is deliberately not a global setting: the keypads on Send and Repay take an amount that gets
 * signed, and a dollar figure there would be a number nobody can actually enter.
 *
 * The button appears only when a price has been read. `usePrices` answers with an empty object when
 * CoinGecko is rate limited or unreachable, and then this is exactly the screen it was before, which
 * is the behaviour Axel asked for: a snapshot when there is one, and no apology when there is not.
