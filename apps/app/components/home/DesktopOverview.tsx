/**
 * The desktop Overview.
 *
 * Every figure comes from the hooks the phone uses, and most of the blocks are literally the same
 * files. What is desktop-specific is only the arrangement, and this is the second pass at it: the
 * first was the phone's single column split in two, which measured badly enough to be worth
 * recording. At 1440px the content ran 1368px wide (95% of the viewport), the two columns came out
 * 598px and 372px tall so the shorter one held all the data, "Repay" rendered as a 481×56 pill for
 * a five-letter label, and the card artwork (the one object on screen with a fixed size) sat in
 * 517px of container with 177px of air around it. docs/desktop-layout-research.md has the readings
 * and the seventeen sites they were compared against.
 *
 * Three things changed as a result.
 *
 * **One figure leads, not four.** This was a band of four tiles at identical weight, which states
 * that available, limit, balance and lifetime spend are peers. They are one number and three of its
 * derivations, and no banking or card product surveyed renders a row of equal KPI tiles for its
 * primary money figures. `OverviewHeadline` leads with the figure the next action depends on, which
 * is spending power most days and the balance inside an open cycle.
 *
 * **The actions sit on the title line, beside the figure they act on.** Mercury's credit page header
 * is `Credit Card · How limits work · Request a limit increase · Pay`; Chase groups limit, balance
 * and available credit in one panel with Make a Payment in the same view. `PageHeader` has had an
 * `action` slot since it was written and nothing ever passed one, so the right thousand pixels of
 * this row were empty on both desktop screens.
 *
 * **The rail is sized to the card.** `400px` rather than a fraction, because its contents have a
 * natural width (a 340px card image) and a fluid column just pads it. Stripe, coinbase and privacy
 * all name their column widths in pixels for the same reason.
 *
 * **It sticks.** `items-start` is what allows that: a stretched grid item is as tall as its row and
 * has nothing to stick within.
 */

/**
 * What the card can do, at desktop button size.
 *
 * Settling leads when there is something to settle: only a repayment that clears the balance closes
 * a cycle, but it never replaces the other two. The figure it refers to is in the strip above, so
 * this is the control alone rather than a panel restating the balance.
