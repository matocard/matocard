/**
 * The one figure the desktop Overview leads with, and it is not always the same figure.
 *
 * **This replaces a band of four equal tiles.** Available, limit, balance and lifetime spend were
 * rendered at identical weight, which says they are four peers; they are one number and three of
 * its derivations. Not one banking or card product surveyed uses a row of equal KPI tiles for its
 * primary money figures. Mercury's nearest equivalent is four inline 15px figures under a 19px
 * heading, deliberately subordinate.
 *
 * **It flips when a balance is open, and that is the rule every credit product follows.** Brex
 * leads with "the amount that you owe when your next statement is due"; Mercury leads with Total
 * Balance and demotes availability to a small line beneath. The rule underneath is: lead with the
 * figure the next action depends on. Most days that is spending power. Inside an open cycle it is
 * the repayment.
 *
 * **Set at reading size, not hero size.** Measured in Mercury's own app at 1278px: nothing on the
 * dashboard or the credit page exceeds 28px, and the balance, the page title and the greeting are
 * all the same 28px. The 65px figures reported for Mercury belong to its marketing site, not its
 * product. `CreditScreen` currently renders the same limit at 54px through a `clamp()` whose fluid
 * term is dead past a 450px viewport, so one number appears at two sizes 2.5x apart depending on
 * which page you are on.
 *
 * **"Balance" is Axel's choice over "You owe".** It is what Mercury and Brex use and it is short,
 * but on a product that is both debit and credit the word does not say which direction it points,
 * which is the ambiguity that made Amex name three separate balances. Two things compensate: the
 * figure takes the negative tone when anything is owed, and the tile beside it changes from Limit
 * to Still to spend, so the pair under the figure says which direction the headline points.

        Two tiles rather than a run-on caption.

        These two facts used to be a sentence under the figure: "of 41.4594 tCTC limit · score 42",
        with a middot doing the work of a divider. Two unrelated numbers joined by punctuation read
        as one clause about the figure above them, which is not what they are: each is a heading of
        its own with a value under it. Axel asked for them to have a section, and this is it.

        `StatStrip` is the component that already draws exactly this, hairlines and all. It was
        written for four tiles, unused since this headline replaced that band, and two of it is what
        was wanted here: four said available, limit, balance and lifetime spend were peers, and two
        says these are the two supporting readings of the one figure above.

        Which two depends on the headline, the same way the headline itself does. Inside an open
        cycle the limit is not the useful number, what is left to spend is.
