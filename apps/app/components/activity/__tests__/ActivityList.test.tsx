 * The list renders the six kinds `useTransactions` emits and nothing else.
 *
 * It used to be tested against `rebalanced` and `proposed-exit`: an automated agent moving money
 * between yield buckets, with a Review button for approving a proposed exit. Nothing in
 * Matocard sets `review`, and no row has since the port, so the affordance and its fourteen sibling
 * cases were asserting behaviour the product does not have.
