/**
 * Deposits locked on another chain and not yet delivered.
 *
 * Ported from the card screen in `apps/app/src` that this app replaced, because the problem it
 * solves is real and independent of which app renders it: Wormhole guardians sign at finalized
 * consistency, so the money leaves the wallet minutes before the limit moves. Without a row saying
 * so, the screen shows a deposit that did nothing, and that reads as a broken product rather than a
 * pending one.
 *
 * **`slow` is not `failed`.** Past the nominal wait the API reports a deposit as slow, and this
 * says exactly that. Nothing has gone wrong; guardians sign on their own schedule and the deposit
 * still lands. Calling it an error would send people looking for a problem that does not exist.
 *
 * Every figure arrives formatted from the API: the amount already scaled by the asset's own
 * decimals, the chain already named, the explorer link already built, so this holds no decimals
 * table and no chain map.
