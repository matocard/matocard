/**
 * What is still owed on the card.
 *
 * **This used to be lifetime spend and it was answering the wrong question.** It summed every
 * `Draw` event and never netted repayments off, which is a true figure and not the one anybody
 * opens Home to check. Worse, it was rendered only when nothing was owed, so the screen showed
 * "Spent from your card 13 tCTC" immediately after a repayment cleared the balance, and showed
 * nothing at all while there was a balance to clear. Exactly backwards. Axel repaid in full and
 * reasonably read the 13 as still outstanding.
 *
 * So the row is the balance, it is always rendered, and it goes to zero when the card is settled.
 * Lifetime spending is still on Credit, where the chart is about history.
 *
 * **Read from the chain, not the indexer.** `accountOf.drawn` is the outstanding principal and it
 * is what `repay` settles against. The indexer's `Account` row is as of that account's last
 * transaction, so for the seconds after a repayment it still reports the old debt, which is the one
 * moment this row is being looked at hardest.
 *
 * A zero is shown rather than hidden. "0 tCTC" is the answer to "do I owe anything", and it is the
 * answer people come here for. An unread figure is still withheld: the row disappears while the
 * call is in flight, because an unresolved read is not a zero.
