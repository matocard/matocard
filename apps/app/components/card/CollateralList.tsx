/**
 * What the limit is built on, one row per asset.
 *
 * The column that matters is **proved**, not locked. A deposit sitting in the Sepolia vault raises
 * nothing until Attestcoin has carried it across, which takes seven to nine minutes. During that
 * window the two numbers genuinely disagree, and a row that showed only the locked amount would be
 * claiming credit the chain has not granted yet. So a crossing asset says so, in words.
 *
 * Assets with nothing in them are dropped rather than listed at zero: three empty stablecoin rows
 * tell the holder nothing except that the screen has rows.
 *
 * **A read still in flight is a skeleton, never an absence.** The two carriers are read from
 * different chains and arrive seconds apart: Sepolia answers in well under a second and the
 * Wormhole hub sits on Monad, whose RPC takes about four seconds a call and is asked several
 * times. Rendering only what had landed meant the card appeared complete, with BNB simply missing,
 * and then grew a row underneath the reader. A short row of placeholders says "there is more" for
 * the same reason an unread figure is a dash rather than a zero.
 *
 * **The second figure is what the asset is worth, not what it lends.** It used to be the holding
 * priced in tCTC, which is the credit the chain grants against it. Those are different questions and
 * the tCTC one is already answered by the headline on this screen. So the row now reads 50.00 tUSDC
 * and $50.00, from CoinGecko.
 *
 * A reader may notice that the deposits add up to more than the limit does, by a lot. That is real
 * and it is not a bug here: the chain prices 1 tUSDC at 1 tCTC while the market prices USDC at a
 * dollar and MON at about ten cents, so a testnet price table is meeting a mainnet one. `prices.ts`
 * has the longer version. Nothing on this screen makes a lending decision, so the mismatch is
 * visible rather than load-bearing.
 *
 * **Every row carries its network, and no row is a link.** Both of those are corrections.
 *
 * The network, because USDC on Base and USDC on Arbitrum are different assets in different vaults:
 * two rows reading "USDC" with no chain would be indistinguishable and wrong. The Sepolia rows used
 * to spend that line on "Released by us, not by you", which answered a question about withdrawal on
 * a list that is not about withdrawal, and left the one fact every other row showed missing from
 * these two.
 *
 * No link, because only the Wormhole rows had one. A chevron on one row and not the next reads as a
 * feature that failed to load rather than as a property of the carrier, and the list was the wrong
 * place to carry that distinction anyway: it exists to say what backs the limit. Withdrawal lives in
 * the overflow menu, where it can list only what is actually withdrawable without half the rows
 * having to explain themselves.

    The filter was `locked > 0 || proved > 0`, and a released deposit satisfies the first half
    forever: the tokens stay in the vault until the holder claims them, so the row sat here reading
    "0.00 tUSDC" under a heading that says Assets held. Zero is the honest figure for this card,
