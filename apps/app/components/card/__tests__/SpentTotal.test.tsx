 * The one row on Home that answers "do I still owe anything".

 * repayments never netted off, and rendered only when nothing was owed. So a card with a balance
 * showed no row at all, and a card that had just been paid off showed "13 tCTC", which reads as
 * still outstanding. These tests pin the inversion closed.
