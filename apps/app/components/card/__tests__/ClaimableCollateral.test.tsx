 * The nudge for money the protocol has finished moving and the borrower has not signed for.
 *
 * @FjrREPO's framing in #8, and the distinction the whole component rests on: between the relay
 * approving a release and the borrower claiming it, **nothing is waiting on the protocol**. So this
 * is a nudge, not a spinner, and it has to disappear when there is nothing to nudge about, because
 * a prompt that is always on screen is not a prompt.
