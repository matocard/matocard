/**
 * The card in its folder, with nothing around it. Home and /card both render this, so the card
 * cannot drift into two different cards.
 *
 * The folder is deliberately NOT `disabled` while the card is unissued: that prop drops the whole
 * component to `opacity-50`, which turns the black card a washed grey and reads as a rendering bug
 * rather than as an empty wallet. The masked digits already say there is nothing to reveal.
 *
 * Nothing here is ever fabricated. Until `card.number` arrives from the backend the folder shows
 * its masked state, because a card is a claim about a real identity and a plausible-looking
 * placeholder is the one thing this must not show.
 *
 * **The reveal needs a second request.** `GET /account/:wallet` carries the number already masked
 * and no CVV at all, so the eye toggle on its own has nothing to unmask: it reveals the same dots
 * it was already showing. `useCardSecrets` fetches the full card from `/account/:wallet/card`, and
 * only once the holder asks, which keeps the PAN out of memory until then. Until it lands the
 * folder stays masked rather than flashing a half-filled number.
