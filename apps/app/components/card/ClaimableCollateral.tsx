/**
 * Collateral that is out of the vault's hands and into the borrower's, waiting on their signature.
 *
 * @FjrREPO's words for it in #8: *a nudge, not a spinner*. Between the relay approving a release and
 * the borrower claiming it, nothing is waiting on the protocol: the money is sitting in the vault
 * and the only thing left is a transaction the person has not sent. Without this the state is
 * invisible: the limit dropped when they asked, the withdraw screen would show the button, and
 * nothing on Home says to go there. Someone who closed the tab mid-flow has no way back except
 * remembering.
 *
 * **Read from the chain, not the indexer.** `releasable` is the vault's own `nativeReleasable` /
 * `tokenReleasable` for this wallet, which is what `unlockNative` actually checks. The indexer has
 * the same fact in `RemoteWithdrawal` and it has been wrong about it twice today, once because two
 * chains sync out of step and the stages were matched to the wrong row, once because a redeploy
 * dropped the older relays out of the config and their events with them. This is Fajar's own rule
 * back at him: the indexer for history, the chain for anything the user is about to act on.
 *
 * It renders nothing when there is nothing to claim, because a nudge that is always there is not a
 * nudge.
