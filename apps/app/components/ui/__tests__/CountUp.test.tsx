/**
 * The figure on screen has to be the figure it was given, from the first paint.
 *
 * It used to start at zero and rely on an effect to walk up to the value. Measured in the dev
 * browser on 13 September 2026 that walk did not complete: the Credit limit rendered "0 tCTC"
 * against a chain reporting 41.4594, and "In your wallet" showed "0 tCTC" and "0 ETH" against a
 * wallet holding 7,998 tCTC. Swapping the component for plain text made the right figure appear
 * immediately, which is what isolated it to here.
 *
 * **These tests could not have caught the original bug**, and that is worth stating rather than
 * pretending otherwise: the component disabled its own animation under `NODE_ENV=test`, so the
 * test environment always saw the correct value while the browser did not. A component that
 * behaves differently under test is a component whose production behaviour is untested. The
 * assertions below are about the mounted value, which is now the same in both.
