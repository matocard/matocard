/**
 * What has come out of the card and what has gone back, over a chosen window.
 *
 * **Extracted so it can sit beside the figure it explains.** It lived only on Credit, which is the
 * screen a cardholder visits least, while the limit it is a record of leads the Overview. Mercury's
 * credit page puts its summary rail and its chart side by side for exactly this reason: they are
 * two readings of one thing, and splitting them across routes means neither page answers a question
 * on its own.
 *
 * **The range switcher is above the chart now.** It was below it, so the control that decides what
 * you are looking at sat after the thing you had finished looking at. Every reference dashboard puts
 * a range switcher above or beside the chart title.
 *
 * **The bars are events, not a score curve.** The indexer keeps one current score per account and no
 * history of it, so a score line would have to be invented. `Draw` and `Repayment` rows are stamped
 * and real, so the chart shows borrowing, and settled repayments are counted separately because only
 * a repayment that clears the balance closes a cycle and scores.
 *
 * **An indexer that did not answer has not said there is no record.** The failed read gets its own
 * message rather than the empty state, because "Nothing spent yet" would be this component
 * asserting the one thing it currently cannot see.
