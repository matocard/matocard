/**
 * Where the limit came from, shown as the arithmetic it is.
 *
 * **The one screen whose subject is how a limit is earned did not show how it was arrived at.** It
 * printed a figure and left the reader to take it on faith, which is a poor trade on a product
 * whose whole pitch is that the number moves in response to what you do. Mercury puts a "How limits
 * work" link in its credit header for a limit that is simply set; this one is earned, so the working
 * is worth more than a link.
 *
 * Two rows, not three. The result row was going to repeat "Your limit" and the same figure inside a
 * 400px card that states both directly above it, so the working is the two inputs and the headline
 * is the answer they multiply to. That is a deliberate departure from the sketch Axel approved,
 * made because the duplication only became visible once it was on screen.
 *
 * **The percentage is derived from the two figures beside it, not from `borrowableBps`.** Integer
 * division truncates 8291.87 to 8291, so a ratio taken from basis points renders 82.91% while the
 * limit on screen reflects 82.9187%, and the three rows would visibly fail to multiply through by
 * about 0.004 tCTC. Deriving it from what is actually displayed makes the arithmetic exact as
 * rendered. `borrowableBps` is still the answer when there is no collateral to divide by.
