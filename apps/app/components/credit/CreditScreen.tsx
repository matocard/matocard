/**
 * What the card has earned, which is a record rather than a yield.
 *
 * This screen took over the Earn tab's shape: headline, sub-line, two actions, a bar chart with
 * four ranges, and changed everything it was reporting. Earn promised APY on deposits into
 * buckets: no part of that exists here, users receive no yield at all, and the numbers on it were a
 * different product's. The layout was worth keeping; the subject was not.
 *
 * **The headline is the limit, not the score.** The score was the headline first, and it read as a
 * fault: it sits at zero straight after a deposit that plainly worked, because a deposit buys a
 * limit and only borrowing and repaying earns a score. Two numbers, one moving and one not, with
 * nothing on screen connecting them. The limit is the figure a deposit actually changes.
 *
 * **The bars are events, not a score curve.** The indexer keeps one current score per account and
 * no history of it, so a score line would have to be invented. `Draw` and `Repayment` rows are
 * stamped and real, so the chart shows borrowing, and settled repayments are counted separately
 * because only a repayment that clears the balance closes a cycle and scores.

        This was centred, which is the phone hero's treatment surviving into a 400px card: a centred
        figure with a row of controls under it makes the controls read as its caption. Aligned to one
        edge they read as a column, label then number then what you can do, and the eye travels one
        line rather than three. Home made this change months ago and Credit did not.

        The bottom is 24 rather than 32 so that the buttons sit in the middle of two equal gaps.
        They used to have 32 above and, once `mt-auto` below them resolved to zero, nothing at all
