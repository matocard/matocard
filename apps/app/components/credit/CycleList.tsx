/**
 * Every borrowing cycle this card has been through, and what each one earned.
 *
 * **This is the screen the product's own sentence describes.** "Repay cleanly and the same
 * collateral buys a bigger limit" is a claim about cycles, and a cardholder had no way to see how
 * many they had completed, which ones counted, or why. The limit was a number with no working.
 *
 * **The row that matters most is the one that scored nothing.** `minCycleDuration` is 60 seconds on
 * the deployed contract, so a draw repaid faster settles the debt and moves the score by zero, with
 * no error and nothing on chain to tell it apart from a cycle that scored. Somebody who spent and
 * repaid quickly, twice, would reasonably conclude the scoring is broken. That row now says so.
 *
 * **It does not show the limit at the time, and does not pretend to.** `ScoreChanged` carries score,
 * limit and available together, but the indexer consumes it into one `Account` row and keeps no
 * history, and the Monad RPC's 10-second query timeout makes reading the logs directly
 * impractical (50,000 blocks times out; 5,000 answers in ~1.3s, so a full history is dozens of
 * serial round trips). What is shown is what happened. What the limit was when it happened needs an
 * indexer change, which is filed.
