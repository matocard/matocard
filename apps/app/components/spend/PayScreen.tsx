/**
 * Repaying the card balance.
 *
 * **The amount is typed, and Max is exact.** This was one button for the whole balance, on the
 * grounds that only a payment clearing the balance closes a cycle and a partial one earns nothing.
 * That is true about the scoring and it was the wrong reason: a card does not refuse a payment
 * because it earns the payer nothing, and a person who can pay half should be able to.
 *
 * Max does not go through `quickAmount`. Every other screen can round a quick amount down and lose
 * a speck harmlessly; here the last wei is the difference between closing a cycle and not, so
 * pressing Max records that it was pressed and sends `undefined`, which makes `repay` use the debt
 * it reads from the chain itself.
 *
 * **The sixty-second rule is the other trap.** `minCycleDuration` on the deployed line is 60
 * seconds, and a balance settled faster than that clears the debt while the score stays exactly
 * where it was: no error, no explanation. So the button waits, visibly, and says why. Someone who
 * spent and paid within a few seconds would otherwise conclude the scoring is broken.
 *
 * The exact amount matters either way: `repay()` reverts when `msg.value` exceeds the debt rather
 * than refunding, so `repay` re-reads the account row one call before sending and clamps to it.
