/**
 * Drawing against the card's limit, into the holder's own wallet.
 *
 * **Titled "To my wallet", not "Spend".** This screen is what `SendPicker`'s first row opens, so it
 * carries that row's words: a title that renamed itself between the tap and the screen would read
 * as a different destination. The old title was "Spend", and it was the more flattering word and
 * the less true one: there is no merchant and no payment rail here, so the tCTC lands in the
 * holder's own wallet, a cash advance rather than a purchase. The line under the button has always
 * said so; the title now agrees with it.
 *
 * The file keeps the name `SpendScreen`, and `SpentTotal` keeps "Spent from your card". Those name
 * a limit consumed, which is still the right word for a card meant to be spent at a merchant one
 * day; "Send" describes only what this particular control does today.
 *
 * Both writes here are on **Monad**, not Sepolia. That is the opposite of the deposit screen,
 * and getting it backwards produces a signature that fails on a chain mismatch, so the switch is
 * done for the user instead of being asked for.
