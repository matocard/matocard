 * browsers nobody is demoing from, at the cost of a dependency that touches the camera. Where it is
 * missing the button does not render at all: a scan button that opens a viewfinder and never decodes
 * is worse than a Paste field on its own.

 * The stream is stopped in every exit path, including the one where the component unmounts mid-scan.
 * A camera light left on after the sheet closes reads as the app still watching.
