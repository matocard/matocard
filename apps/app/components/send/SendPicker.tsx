/**
 * Where the credit ends up, asked before the amount.
 *
 * **Both routes go through your own wallet, and the screen says so.** `draw()` ends in
 * `Address.sendValue(payable(msg.sender), amount)`: there is no destination parameter, and there
 * cannot be one: the credit line pays the borrower, and anything after that is an ordinary transfer
 * the line knows nothing about. So "to another wallet" is not a different kind of send, it is the
 * same send plus a second transaction.
 *
 * That is why the subtitles name **signatures** rather than recipients. The recipient is the obvious
 * difference and the uninteresting one; what actually changes is how many times a person signs and
 * how long it takes, and a picker that hid the second signature would be selling a transfer feature
 * this product does not have.
 *
 * The reference app this is modelled on offers "To Kolo User", "To IBAN" and "Between Wallets"
 * alongside. None of those exist here: there is no directory of users, no bank rail, and one wallet
 * per holder, and a row that opens a screen saying "coming soon" is worth less than no row.
