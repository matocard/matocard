/**
 * Where testnet funds come from, and the two kinds are not the same kind of thing.
 *
 * **Gas comes from somebody else.** Google's Sepolia faucet is a captcha-gated form, so it cannot
 * be called from a browser. That row is a link: nothing is minted here, a request is made elsewhere
 * and the ETH turns up later.
 *
 * **Collateral tokens are minted here, for real.** The listed Sepolia tokens are `TestToken`s whose
 * `faucet()` is public with no owner and no cooldown, verified by minting the same token twice in a
 * row from the same wallet. Every row reads "Request" so the section looks like one thing rather
 * than two; what separates them is what happens on tap, and the wallet's own prompt makes a
 * signature unmistakable without the label having to warn about it first.
 *
 * **A request is not finished when it is signed.** The balance on the row only moves once the
 * transaction is mined, so the button waits for the receipt, then invalidates the collateral query
 * so react-query refetches the balance underneath it. Showing a tick at signature time would claim
 * tokens that have not arrived; refetching without waiting would read the old balance and look
 * broken.
 *
 * **Mint switches the chain itself.** The wallet normally sits on Monad, because that is
 * where the limit and the card live, while `faucet()` is on Sepolia. Disabling the button in that
 * state made the common case look broken: a greyed-out control with no way to act on it. So the
 * button stays live and does the switch first, then mints. The wallet still asks before switching,
 * so nothing happens behind the user's back.
 *
 * The token list is read from the chain, never hardcoded: listing a token is a governance call.
