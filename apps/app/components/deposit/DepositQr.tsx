/**
 * Sign this deposit from the phone instead of from this browser.
 *
 * The case it exists for: the app is open on a laptop and the wallet lives on a phone. Before this,
 * that meant WalletConnect or giving up. Now the confirmed amount becomes a QR code the phone's
 * wallet can open directly.
 *
 * **What the code contains is a function call, not an address.** See `lib/matocard/eip681.ts` for
 * the full reasoning; the short version is that a bare vault address would be a trap. The vaults
 * have no `receive()`, so native coin sent to one reverts, and an ERC20 sent to one arrives and is
 * never credited to anybody, with no rescue path. Encoding `lockNative` means a wallet either opens
 * the right confirmation or fails to open anything.
 *
 * **Collapsed by default, and never the only way through.** Wallet support for function-call URIs is
 * uneven: MetaMask Mobile has shipped this broken more than once, most recently in 2026. The button
 * that signs through the connected wallet stays exactly where it was, and this sits under a
 * disclosure beneath it. If the QR does nothing in somebody's wallet, the screen still works.
 *
 * The URI is shown as text under the code as well, because a person who cannot scan it can still
 * read it, and because a QR nobody can verify is a QR nobody should sign.
