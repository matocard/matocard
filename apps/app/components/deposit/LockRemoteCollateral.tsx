/**
 * Locking collateral on a chain Attestcoin cannot reach.
 *
 * Same promise as the Sepolia screen (the asset stays where it is and only a message crosses) but
 * three things differ enough to be worth naming.
 *
 * **The wait is minutes, and how many depends on the chain.** The vault publishes at *finalized*
 * consistency; Base, Arbitrum and Optimism finalize against Ethereum and take about fifteen minutes,
 * while BSC and Fuji finalize themselves and come back in under one. Either way the guardians sign
 * long after the lock confirms, which is
 * a deliberate choice on the contract side: this number decides how much someone may borrow, and
 * instant consistency would credit collateral a reorg could take back. Between the lock and the
 * signature the limit does not move, and a screen that says nothing about it reads as broken.
 *
 * **Wormhole charges a message fee out of the same `msg.value`.** The vault takes the fee first and
 * credits the remainder rather than crediting collateral it does not hold, so locking exactly N
 * means sending N plus the fee. It is zero on these testnets today, which is exactly why it is read
 * rather than assumed.
 *
 * **`lockToken` here is payable**, unlike the Sepolia one, for that same fee.
