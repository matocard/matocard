   * `@x402/core`, `@x402/evm` and `@x402/svm` are direct dependencies for one reason: nothing in
   * this app imports them. `@wagmi/connectors` reaches `@coinbase/cdp-sdk` through its Base Account
   * connector, and that SDK imports all three. The bundler resolves them statically even though the
   * app can never execute a Base Account payment, and an unresolved one fails the whole graph,
   * returning 500 on EVERY route. They are cheaper than the alternatives: stubbing them out removed
   * Coinbase Wallet from the connect modal.
   *
   * The webpack branch only matters under `next build --webpack`; Next 16 uses Turbopack by
   * default. pino-pretty, lokijs and encoding are optional deps the WalletConnect stack probes for
   * and does not need.
