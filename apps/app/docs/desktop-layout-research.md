# Desktop layout: what seventeen finance sites actually do

Measured, not remembered. Every number below was read out of `getComputedStyle` in a real Chrome at
a 1440px viewport on 12 Sep 2026, not recalled from memory or copied from a blog post. The probe
counted every element on the page and reported the most frequent value for each property, so "16px
×2026" means two thousand elements on stripe.com compute to a 16px font size, that is the body
size, not a guess at it.

Two sites refused measurement and are recorded as such rather than filled in: **usa.visa.com** and
**mastercard.us** both deny script execution to the extension, so nothing quantitative came back
from either. **cash.app** answered with a Cloudflare interstitial. Their absence matters, the two
card networks were the ones specifically asked about, so they are named here instead of quietly
dropped.

Grid definitions worth copying verbatim:

```
stripe.com    grid-template-columns: 296px 296px 592px   gap: 16px
coinbase.com  grid-template-columns: 372px 372px         gap: 16px
privacy.com   grid-template-columns: 214px 856px 257px   gap: 16px
lithic.com    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr         gap: 24px 16px
n26.com       grid-template-columns: repeat(12, minmax(0,1fr))  gap: 16px
```

Aave's asset rows step **76px** apart (headings at y=384, 460, 536, 612…), its page title is
**32px/700**, and its content starts at **x=164** in a 1440px viewport, a 160px gutter each side.

## What the numbers say

**Marketing pages and dashboards are two different design problems, and only three of these
seventeen are dashboards.** app.aave.com, debank.com and lithic.com are the ones with a logged-in
surface, and they are the ones that matter here: Matocard's Overview is a dashboard, not a landing
page. The three of them agree on things the marketing sites do not.

1. **A dashboard header is short and solid.** Aave 48px on `#1b2030`, debank 65px on white with a
   1px border, lithic 65px on white. Marketing headers are 72–102px and transparent, because they
   float over a hero. A dashboard header is chrome: it earns its height back as content.

2. **Content stops between 1200 and 1280px.** Aave 1240, privacy 1280, coinbase 1200, robinhood
   1280, square 1280, klarna 1140, stripe 1232 of usable width inside 1266. Revolut goes down to
   **1000**. Nothing that is read rather than scrolled runs edge to edge.

3. **Dense financial UI reads at 14px, not 16px.** Aave computes 14px on 601 elements against 122
   at 16px: the whole app is 14px and 16px is the exception. Lithic is 16/14 nearly evenly split.
   Marketing sites are 16px almost without exception, and one (wise.com) leads at 18px.

4. **Radii are bimodal and the two modes mean different things.** Buttons and chips are pills
   (9999, 99999, 100000, 500). Containers are small: 4 (stripe, aave), 6, 8, 12 (mercury, brex,
   ramp, privacy, coinbase). Only Monzo and lithic go past 24px, and both are marketing pages
   where a card is a poster. **No dashboard in this set uses a container radius above 8px.**

5. **The spacing scale is 4/8/12/16/24/32/40/48/64, everywhere, without exception.** Sixteen of
   seventeen sites' most frequent gaps are drawn from it. Off-scale values (wise's 37.5px, ramp's
   6.1px font) are all computed from `clamp()` or a transform, never authored.

6. **Fixed pixel columns are normal.** Stripe, coinbase and privacy all name column widths in px
   rather than fractions. A panel whose contents have a natural size (a card image, a form) gets
   a px column; only the reading column gets `1fr`.

## Measured against this app

The same probe, run against `localhost:3000/home` at the same 1440px viewport:

```
header            65px                       ✓ inside the dashboard band (48–65)
content column    x=36, width 1368           ✗ 95% of the viewport; the band is 1200–1280
columns           573px / 775px, gap 20px    ✗ 20 is off-scale; a 573px rail holds a 340px card
left column       598px tall
right column      372px tall                 ✗ 226px of imbalance, and the shorter one is the data
"Repay" button    481 × 56                   ✗ a 481px pill for a five-letter label
"Spend" button    252 × 56                   ✗ no reference renders a desktop button above ~200px
card artwork      340 × 196 inside 517px     ✗ 177px of air around the one object with a real size
page title        none                       ✗ every reference names the page; Aave at 32px/700
summary figures   none                       ✗ limit, available and owed are scattered or absent
```

Six of the eight are the same fault: **the desktop screen is the phone screen with a second column
bolted on.** `w-full h-14` buttons, a 22px card radius, a 26px centred hero and a single-column
stack are all correct decisions for a 390px viewport, and all of them are wrong at 1440px because
nothing about them was re-decided.

The seventh and eighth are the expensive ones. There is no page title and no summary row, so a
screen whose entire subject is three numbers: what the limit is, what is left to spend, what is
owed: leads with none of them in a place the eye lands first. Aave gives that job to a full-width
panel above the columns. debank gives it to a summary row. This app gives it to a figure inside a
card inside the left column, and puts the balance owed in a sub-panel that only exists when it is
non-zero.

## What was changed as a result

| Reading | Change |
| --- | --- |
| content 1200–1280 | container capped at 1280, `px-10`, so 1440 yields 1200 of content |
| fixed px rails | `grid-cols-[400px_minmax(0,1fr)]`: the rail is sized to the card artwork |
| gap 16–24 | 20px gap replaced with 24 |
| dashboard 14px | desktop rows and labels moved onto 14/13, off the 15/16 mobile sizes |
| container radius ≤ 8 on dashboards | kept 22px, see the note below |
| buttons are not full-width | `Button` gained a `size`; desktop uses `md` (44px) in a 400px rail |
| every page is named | `PageHeader` |
| the summary comes first | `StatStrip`: one card, four hairline-separated tiles |

The radius is the one reading deliberately not followed. Every dashboard in the set sits at 4–8px
and this app sits at 22px, but that 22px is not an accident of the port: it is the radius of the
card artwork, the bottom sheet and the pill buttons, and it is what makes the product look like a
piece of consumer hardware rather than a trading terminal. Copying Aave's 4px would make the app
look like Aave. The reading is recorded so the choice is visible as a choice.

## The second pass, 13 September 2026

The first pass rebuilt Overview. Credit was left as it was, and five agents were then run over both
screens to find what the rebuild had missed. What follows is what they found and what came of it,
including the things that were tried and thrown away, because a rejected approach that is not
written down gets tried again.

### Screens nobody could reach

`(flow)` routes redirect on desktop, and the redirect list named `/deposit/` as a prefix. That
matched `/deposit/x/[id]`, the cross-chain deposit screen, and sent it to the drawer the link had
been clicked in. A desktop cross-chain deposit went in a circle and nothing reported an error.

`lib/matocard/desktopRoutes.ts` now holds both lists as one function, so a caller cannot consult one
and forget the other, and it is tested as a function rather than by rendering a layout once per
path.

### A magic number copied twenty-one times

`min-h-[calc(100dvh-92px)]` appeared in seven files. The 92 is `pt-[52px]` plus `pb-10` on the
`(flow)` layout, added up by hand, and nothing connected the two. Changing that padding would have
left every flow screen the wrong height with no error and nothing to grep for.

The layout is `min-h-dvh` with `border-box`, so its content box is already exactly `100dvh - 92px`.
It is now a flex column and the screens inside are `flex-1`, which measures the same thing without
naming it. Measured at 1800x1044: `/send/me`, `/pay`, `/send/to`, `/deposit/x/[id]` and
`/withdraw/[sym]` all report 952px, the figure the calc produced, with no page scroll.

### Two columns cannot line themselves up

Both desktop screens were a grid of two independent flex columns. Each column stacked its own
blocks, so the second block in each started wherever the first happened to end.

On Credit the rail ran out 46px above the record. On Overview, with a single asset held, "Assets
held" sat 11px above "In your wallet" and the two headings visibly failed to line up.

**Stretching the short column to match was tried first and is worse.** Both Credit columns then
measured 811px and the page filled the viewport, but the empty space simply moved inside the cards:
a hole between the buttons and the footer of a 400px card. A card with a gap in the middle of it
reads as broken rather than as spacious. This is the approach not to try again.

What shipped instead is rows:

- **Credit**: the limit and the chart share the top row and end level because the grid makes them,
  and the cycles run the full width underneath. The chart is the block that stretches, which is the
  right way round: a plot with more height is a better plot, where a list with more height is just a
  list with a hole under it. At 1636x898 both top-row cards run 181 to 504 and the plot went from
  118px to 191px.
- **Overview**: the blocks are the grid's own children rather than two nested columns, each naming
  its column explicitly. Explicitly, because three of them return null when they have nothing to
  say, and auto-placement would have slid the wallet card into the rail the moment no assets were
  held. `items-start` here rather than `items-stretch`, for the reason above: a held-asset card with
  one row would gain 30px of blank space under it.

### Figures that were animations rather than figures

`CountUp` started at zero and walked up. Measured in the browser that walk did not always complete:
the Credit limit rendered "0 tCTC" against a chain reporting 41.4594, and "In your wallet" showed
"0 tCTC" against a wallet holding 7,998.

It could not have been caught by a test, and that is the part worth keeping: the component disabled
its own animation under `NODE_ENV=test`, so the test environment always saw the right value while
the browser did not. A component that behaves differently under test is a component whose production
behaviour is untested. It now mounts at its value, and a settle timer guarantees the figure lands
even if the tween is stranded.

### Overrides that lose silently

Tailwind emits utilities in numeric order, not in the order a class attribute lists them: `.mt-0` is
emitted at line 744 of the built CSS and `.mt-4` at 772. So a component that builds its classes with
a template string and appends the caller's `className` does not let the caller win, it lets the
larger number win.

`cn()` with `extendTailwindMerge` is the fix, and the custom radius scale has to be declared to it
or `rounded-card rounded-none` does not resolve either. `Bars` was converted when its `h-[118px]`
needed to be beaten by a caller.

### Still open

- `StatStrip` draws its dividers by index arithmetic rather than in CSS.
- The shell constants are still duplicated: `h-16` on the navigation bar against `top-[88px]`
  elsewhere.
- `.stagger > *` animates direct children to `opacity: 1`, and an animation beats a utility class,
  so anything placed inside a stagger wrapper is permanently visible. Left until last deliberately:
  it is load-bearing on both screens and changing it moves everything at once.
